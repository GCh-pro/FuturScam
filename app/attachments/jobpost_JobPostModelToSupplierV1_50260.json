We support companies who want to recode trade for the digital era.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Together with disruptors, technologists and visionaries, we build a more fertile trade environment. We co-design ambitious visions. We experiment and launch new solutions. We turn innovations into new growth engines.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We are backed by Credendo, the Export Credit Agency from Belgium and the most trusted leader in trade credit insurance and surety bonds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>​Focus:</strong></p>\n<p>Our current investment thesis revolves around big untapped opportunities related to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Platforms and marketplaces,</li>\n<li>SMEs and freelancers,</li>\n<li>Innovative credit data and machine learning,</li>\n<li>Blockchain and other new trade paradigms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For us, success can be measured in the upgrades we offer to trade ecosystems. We do not see technology as an objective in itself, but we believe it is key to unlock radical improvements for trade and accompanying risk. We take inspiration from diverse universes. We try to hack things, fail sometimes, always learn, and thrive when we co-innovate with partners who share our passion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Structure:</strong></p>\n<p>AREA42 is an ecosystem with 3 highly complementary zones: AREA42 innovation community, AREA42 innovation lab, and AREA42 accelerator. Each zone contributes to a successful AREA42 innovation ecosystem.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our innovation community aims at growing a high-quality network of trusted partners, open to co-innovation and passionate about upgrading trade; the community creates a fertile ground to elaborate and discuss ambitious ideas and concepts.</li>\n<li>Our innovation lab takes a lean startup approach to experiment with new ideas and incubate them to become validated product concepts with a market fit. The learnings, successes and failures contribute to the feedback-loop and are shared with our innovation community.</li>\n<li>Our accelerator works like a growth factory. We take validated product concepts and turn them into new lines of business. Our accelerator team works with the same powerful means as the best high-growth startups in order to scale the most ambitious ventures in trade.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our first basecamps are Paris, Prague and Brussels, but our playground is Europe and the world.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Culture:</strong></p>\n<p>We are a diverse team with simple beliefs: we value respect, mutual trust, entrepreneurship, collective creativity, technological excellence and solid execution. For us, these values are essential to creating high-impact innovations, which we need to deliver successful long-term growth, which will help spread an innovation culture in trade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Often, we do not know exactly what we are building. However, we always start with an exciting vision and we iterate as fast as possible to confront it with reality. We have faith in the science of experimentation and in the lean startup approach. We invite and welcome innovators of all kind to contribute and to have an impact. We share together the benefits of our successes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","companyInfo":{"companyId":"44dfd932-2d1e-4df1-be56-c87d2bb3a153","companyName":"Credendo","companyLogoUrl":"https://prdpustormainpubsa.blob.core.windows.net/public/prounity/web/companies/44dfd9322d1e4df1be56c87d2bb3a153/logos/yoytbo2b_ypz.png","factoringEnabled":true,"departmentId":"d0f74637-c0f2-42fb-925d-12a15cf46f3a","departmentName":"Area42","departmentLogoUrl":"https://prdpustormainpubsa.blob.core.windows.net/public/prounity/web/companies/44dfd9322d1e4df1be56c87d2bb3a153/departments/d0f74637c0f242fb925d12a15cf46f3a/logos/mx0vtodd_ykw.jpeg","showDepartmentNameAsMain":false,"showDepartmentLogoAsMain":false,"suffix":null},"locationInfo":{"locations":[{"street":"remote work","number":"","city":"Remote","zipCode":"0000","country":"Belgium","region":null}],"mainLocation":{"street":"remote work","number":"","city":"Remote","zipCode":"0000","country":"Belgium","region":null},"remoteOption":"Full"},"attachmentInfo":{"mandatoryDocuments":[],"additionalDocuments":[]},"roleInfo":{"roles":[{"name":"Public relations (PR) Officer","seniority":"Senior","seniorityLabel":"Senior","lastUsageTime":"AnyTime","lastUsageTimeLabel":"Any time","comment":null}]},"skillInfo":{"skills":[]},"languageInfo":{"languageGroups":[{"languages":["Dutch","French"],"languageLevel":"NiceToHave","languageLevelLabel":"Nice to have"},{"languages":["English"],"languageLevel":"ProfessionalWorking","languageLevelLabel":"Professional working proficiency"}]},"questionInfo":{"questions":[]},"metadata":{"requirementConfiguration":{"roleSeniorityAnswers":[{"label":"No experience","description":""},{"label":"Junior","description":"Between 1-3 years"},{"label":"Medior","description":"Between 4-6 years"},{"label":"Senior","description":"7 years or more"}],"roleLastUsageTimeAnswers":[{"label":"No experience","description":"Candidate never worked within this role in a professional context"},{"label":"This year","description":"Candidate has been working within this role during the last 12 months"},{"label":"1 to 3 years ago","description":"Candidate didn't fulfill this role within the last 12 months, but he did within the last 3 years"},{"label":"More than 3 years ago","description":"Candidate didn't fulfill this role within the last 3 years, but he has past experience within this role"}],"skillSeniorityAnswers":[{"label":"No experience","description":"No level of competence - no work experience in this skill area (academic knowledge)"},{"label":"Beginner","description":"Limited work experience within this area.
